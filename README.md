# README: Enhanced Bayesian Optimization Benchmarking

## Project Name: Enhanced Benchmarking of Bayesian Optimization for Experimental Materials Science Domains

### Overview

This project is an extension and enhancement of the work presented in the paper "Benchmarking the Performance of Bayesian Optimization across Multiple Experimental Materials Science Domains" by Harry Qiaohao Liang. The original project evaluated the efficiency of Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms across various experimental materials systems, providing valuable insights into surrogate models and acquisition functions.

### Original Paper

The benchmarking project is based on the work conducted by Harry Qiaohao Liang, as detailed in the paper:

- **Title:** Benchmarking the performance of Bayesian optimization across multiple experimental materials science domains.
- **Authors:** Harry Qiaohao Liang, Aldair Gongora, Danny Zekun Ren, Armi Tiihonen, et al.
- **Published in:** npj Computational Materials (2021)
- **DOI:** [10.1038/s41524-021-00656-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00656-9)
- **GitHub Repository:** [Benchmarking](https://github.com/PV-Lab/Benchmarking)

### Project Enhancements

In this enhanced version, I have replicated the results from the original paper and improved the codebase. The enhancements aim to provide a more streamlined and accessible implementation of the benchmarking framework, with improvements in code organization, documentation, and user experience.

### Usage

- Run `Enhanced Example use of framework with RF and GP type surrogate models.ipynb` with any of the given datasets to benchmark the performance of a selected BO algorithm using the pool-based active learning framework.
- Run `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` with any of the given datasets to visualize its design space.
- Run `Generate Visuals.ipynb` with given demo benchmarking results or any benchmarking results from running the framework locally.

### Package Contents

- `Enhanced Example use of framework with RF and GP type surrogate models.ipynb`: Script for running the enhanced framework.
- `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`: Script for visualizing each dataset.
- - `Generate Visuals.ipynb`: Script for visualizing materials dataset design spaces.
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages.

### Datasets

For reuse of code and materials datasets in this repository, please cite the original work by Harry Qiaohao Liang. Materials datasets used in this enhanced benchmarking are the same as those provided in the original repository.

### Acknowledgment

I extend my appreciation to Harry Qiaohao Liang and the original collaborators for their valuable work and contributions. The enhanced benchmarking project builds upon their foundation to provide an improved and user-friendly experience.
